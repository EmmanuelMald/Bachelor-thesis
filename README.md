# Bachelor-thesis
In this repository I added the scripts I wrote to clean, filter and visualize data.

Author: Emmanuel Amador Maldonado

Scripts generated were developed for a bachelor's final work (thesis).
The use of Python was mainly to knowing three out of eight objectives of the work.

1.- Know the municipality in Mexico that has the highest production of 
    sustainable felling of pine and oak trees.

2.- Know the solar irradiance resource in the selected municipality based on 
    data collected from NASA's Data Access Viewer. This objective is divided in three. 

      2.1.- Know the hourly solar irradiance at the Earth's surface (Terrestrial Irradiance)
            of an average day of each month of the year.
      
      2.2.- Know the hourly solar irradiance at the top of the Atmosphere (Extraterrestrial Irradiance)
            of an average day of each month of the year.
      
      2.3.- Compare both, extraterrestrial and terrestrial irradiances.
      
3.- Know the improvement in solar irradiance captation between a fixed parabolic  trough solar 
    concentrator and a 1-axis tracking concentrator.


It is recommended to open files in the next order.
NOTE: Codes in TERRESTRIAL SOLAR RESOURCE and EXTRATERRESTRIAL SOLAR RESOURCE files are the same; 
      data is also equivalent.
